## Installation

Installer scripts for Windows, Linux and OSX are provided.

1. Download .zip from [the latest release](https://github.com/Glitchtest51/plex-discord-rpc/releases) and extract it.
2. Run the installer script of your platform.
    * **MacOS**: not sure, pr or issue if you know
    **Linux**: not sure, pr or issue if you know
    * **Windows**: run `install_windows.bat` by double clicking on it for Windows

## Configurations

For OSX and Linux, config file is located in `not sure, pr or issue if you know`.

For Windows, config file is located at `%localappdata%\Plex\script-opts`.

* **key** (default: `D`): key binding to toggle activation on the fly
* **active** (default: `yes`): whether to activate at launch
* **client_id**: specify your own client ID to [customize](#customization) the images shown in Rich Presence
* **autohide_threshold** (default: `0`): time in seconds before hiding the presence once player is paused (`0` is off)

## Customization

Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
create an application and upload the following art assets with their corresponding asset keys:
* `mpv`: large image (app logo)
* `play`: small image used when playing
* `pause`: small image used when paused
* `stop`: small image used when idle

Then, set the `client_id` option in the config to the application ID.

You can also find the already provided client ids and their image assets [here](./assets/).
